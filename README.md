# NAMD Regression Tests

This is a set of regression tests for NAMD, starting with tests for alchemical perturbation, with and without the IDWS scheme.

Created using the layout and scripts of the [Colvars](https://github.com/Colvars/colvars) regression tests.
Credits to Giacomo Fiorin for much of the scripting.
