> Warning: The period of outputting energies relating to alchemical transformations (alchOutFreq = 4) is not a multiple of the period of computing energies (computeEnergies = 1000). If alchOutFreq is smaller than outputEnergies and computeEnergies is not defined, a better solution is to set computeEnergies explicitly and keep it the same as alchOutFreq. The simulation will use the greatest common divisor of computeEnergies and alchOutFreq as the period of energy evaluation.
